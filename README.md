Project: Wireframe, Prototype and Mockup for giving form  The current giving form is accessible at http://giving.columbia.edu/giveonline/. To be able to go through the full process, including an email receipt and a the thank you confirmation page, use https://staging.alumni.columbia.edu/giveonline/ with the dummy Visa card 4111111111111111, an expiration date in the future, and any CVV code.  Requirements: responsive design (phone and tablet) easy to give from desktop and mobile devices  Current pain points: Donors currently have a lot of difficulty to find the fund they want to give to because of the very long selection of schools in the dropdown. Google analytics indicate that 70% of donors drop off on the page where they need to enter their address information.  With the above in mind, please provide us with designs for the new giving form as you would design it. You don't need to keep anything from the current giving form even though we'll need most of the fields currently there. If you go through some wireframing, please provide us with wireframes as well. In addition to to the designs, please write up what your design process was while going through this exercise. If you can also indicate time you spent on the major phases of your design process, that would be useful too.  I'd suggest to spend not more than 4 hours to come up with the designs (mockups). The next step would be to implement the design using HTML, CSS and Javascript (prototype).
